    <h6>The Fine Print<br>

        BorrowBot is a data collection, parsing, and analytics engine.  Any use of "scores" and "grades" are simply one very dumb robot's guess at the repayability of a loan.  Please don't use this as a basis of who is deserving of a loan and who isn't.  He doesn't know.  Seriously, did you look at those stats?  He's not even sure what day it is sometimes.  The main point here is that you shouldn't use these stats as investment advice, they aren't.  They are for fun and novelty only.  Only a fool would trust this stuff.
