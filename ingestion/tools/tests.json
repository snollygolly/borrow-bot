I'm utterly desperate here (especially with regards to my prescription) and would be very thankful to anyone who can help. \n\nI'm currently located in Tean near Stoke-On-Trent in Staffordshire in the UK (yes, my address does have that many identifiers) and the only payment method I have access to is PayPal. Again, I'm very desperate and having never done this before I'm panicking that I've done this wrong or will do it wrong, but I think I've followed all the steps correctly however please try and keep this in mind if you do decide to help. \n\nTL;DR Have no money, need £30 for a prescription and food, no one else can help me here. Will pay back £40 on Friday as soon as it goes into my account. Literally just for a few days so I can make it. \n\nFor the record, while many of my previous comments state my location as the USA I moved several months ago. This coincides with the end of my very regular posting and is related to the reason I have no money.\n\n**EDIT:** It's been suggested that my account is not active enough, so let me assure you that for the last few months I've been limited to internet on my phone (and still am) which makes commenting less intuitive for me. However I am on here everyday (although I understand I have no way to prove that, and so it's an empty sentence). I'd also like to reiterate (hopefully without sounding whiny) that this is a complete emergency for me and while I'm sure the complexity of my situation isn't endearing me to anyone, I'll explain it to anyone who asks. \n\n\n\n",

Without my phone, it is much more difficult to communicate my medical needs back and forth. \n\nThat being said, I need assistance.

And while Paypal (verified) is an option, it would be even better if a direct payment could be made to my phone company so that my service can be restored immediately. That being said, I'll take what I can get. :)\n\nThank you so much, Reddit users. Your generosity and ability to work with people in their time of need never ceases to amaze me.\n\n[Edit: Increased the amount of interest, thanks to the advice of a kind commenter.]",

I plan to pay the full amount back in two payments: $69 on 12/1/2015, and $69 on 1/1/2016. I will also tack on an extra $26 in interest to both payments, making that $190 in total paid back to the loaner.\n\nMy location is Austin, TX, USA.
